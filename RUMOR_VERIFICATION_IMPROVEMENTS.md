# Rumor Verification System - Accuracy Improvements

## üéØ Problem Analysis

The NerdAlert agent was experiencing critical accuracy issues, particularly:

1. **Deadpool 3 Error**: Claiming Deadpool 3 was still a "rumor" when it was actually released in July 2024
2. **Fake Projects**: Mentioning non-existent projects like "Avengers: Doomsday" as confirmed
3. **Outdated Information**: Not properly distinguishing between released, confirmed, and rumored content
4. **Lack of Cross-Reference**: Not verifying information against authoritative sources

## ‚úÖ Solution: Automated Rumor Verification System

### New Features Implemented:

#### 1. **Specialized Rumor Verification Function**
```typescript
async function verifyRumorOrRelease(movieTitle: string): Promise<RumorVerificationResult>
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if a movie/show is already released (IMDB, official sites)
- Verifies official announcements vs rumors
- Cross-references with current year to detect future dates
- Provides confidence levels and corrections

#### 2. **Auto-Detection of Movie/Show Mentions**
```typescript
async function autoVerifyMovieMentions(userMessage: string): Promise<VerificationResult>
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects movie/show titles in user queries
- Uses pattern matching for common franchise names
- Verifies each mention before responding
- Provides real-time corrections to the AI

#### 3. **Enhanced System Prompt Integration**
- Adds verification results directly to the system prompt
- Provides context about what's confirmed vs rumor
- Includes corrections and warnings
- Stores verification results in conversation memory

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Search Strategy:
1. **Release Check**: Search for "movie title release date site:imdb.com"
2. **Official Announcement**: Search for "movie title confirmed official announcement"
3. **Rumor Detection**: Search for "movie title rumor speculation"
4. **Date Validation**: Cross-check with current year

### Source Priority:
1. **IMDB** - For release dates and cast information
2. **Official Studio Sites** - Marvel.com, Disney.com, etc.
3. **Entertainment News** - Variety, Hollywood Reporter
4. **Fan Sites** - For rumor identification

### Confidence Scoring:
- **HIGH**: Multiple official sources confirm
- **MEDIUM**: Some official sources, some news
- **LOW**: Only fan sites or unclear sources

## üìä Expected Improvements

### For Deadpool 3 Issue:
**Before**: "Deadpool 3 is still a rumor..."
**After**: "üé¨ MOVIE/SHOW VERIFICATION RESULTS:
‚úÖ "Deadpool 3": Released July 26, 2024 (HIGH confidence)
   üìù Correction: Deadpool 3 has already been released, not a rumor"

### For Avengers Doomsday Issue:
**Before**: "Avengers: Doomsday is confirmed for 2026..."
**After**: "üé¨ MOVIE/SHOW VERIFICATION RESULTS:
‚ùì "Avengers Doomsday": Status unclear - may be rumor/speculation
‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFICATION WARNINGS:
‚Ä¢ Future date detected (2025 is current year) - may be speculation"

### For Fantastic Four 2025:
**Before**: "Fantastic Four is rumored for 2025..."
**After**: "üé¨ MOVIE/SHOW VERIFICATION RESULTS:
‚úÖ "Fantastic Four": Confirmed July 25, 2025 (HIGH confidence)"

## üß™ Testing
