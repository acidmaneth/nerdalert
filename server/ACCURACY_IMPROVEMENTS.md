# Accuracy Improvements & Correction Handling - NerdAlert Agent v1.4.0

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document outlines the comprehensive accuracy improvements implemented to **prevent false claims** and **handle user corrections** effectively. The focus is on **prevention over correction** - ensuring the agent provides accurate information from the start.

## 🚀 **Key Improvements**

### **1. Prevention-First Approach**
**Problem**: Agent was making false claims that required user corrections.

**Solution**: 
- **Pre-verification** of all claims before responding
- **Multiple source cross-referencing** for every fact
- **Confidence-based response filtering** - only share verified information
- **Automatic fact-checking** for claims that seem uncertain

### **2. Enhanced Research Accuracy**
**Problem**: Insufficient verification led to inaccurate information.

**Solution**:
- **Enhanced search strategies** with official source prioritization
- **RAG knowledge base integration** for verified facts
- **Real-time verification** against authoritative sources
- **Source hierarchy** - official sites prioritized over speculation

### **3. User Correction Handling**
**Problem**: Agent didn't acknowledge or learn from user corrections.

**Solution**:
- **Automatic correction detection** using pattern matching
- **Correction memory system** to prevent repeating mistakes
- **Verification of corrected information** before accepting it
- **Humble acknowledgment** and appreciation for user knowledge

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced System Prompt**
Added comprehensive accuracy rules:
```text
CRITICAL ACCURACY RULES (PREVENTION OVER CORRECTION):
- ALWAYS verify information before sharing it - accuracy is more important than speed
- If you're not 100% certain about a fact, search for it rather than guessing
- When in doubt, say "I'm not sure about that" and offer to research it
- Never make up character details, plot points, dates, or cast information
- Always cross-reference information from multiple authoritative sources
- If sources disagree, acknowledge the conflict and explain the discrepancy
- Provide confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) for all information shared
```

### **New Accuracy Tools**

#### **1. `check_accuracy_before_response(claim, topic)`**
- Verifies claims against RAG knowledge base and official sources
- Provides confidence levels before sharing information
- Cross-references multiple authoritative sources
- Returns accuracy assessment with recommendations

#### **2. `handle_user_correction(correction, originalTopic)`**
- Detects when users are correcting the agent
- Verifies corrected information against authoritative sources
- Provides confidence assessment for corrections
- Updates understanding for future discussions

### **Enhanced Conversation Memory**
```typescript
export interface Correction {
  originalClaim: string;
  correctedInfo: string;
  topic: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  confidence: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  sources?: string[];
}

export interface ConversationMemory {
  sessionId: string;
  discussedTopics: Set<string>;
  recentMessages: string[];
  corrections: Correction[];    // NEW: Track user corrections
  lastUpdate: Date;
}
```

### **Correction Detection System**
```typescript
export function detectCorrection(message: string): {
  isCorrection: boolean;
  originalClaim?: string;
  correctedInfo?: string;
  topic?: string;
  confidence?: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
}
```

**Detection Patterns**:
- Direct corrections: "that's wrong", "you're incorrect"
- Fact corrections: "actually", "in fact", "the truth is"
- Apology requests: "you should apologize", "you need to correct"
- Specific corrections: "it's not X, it's Y"

## 📊 **Accuracy Verification Workflow**

### **Step 1: Pre-Response Verification**
1. **Claim Analysis**: Identify specific claims in the response
2. **RAG Check**: Verify against knowledge base first
3. **Web Verification**: Cross-reference with official sources
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Determine confidence level
5. **Response Filtering**: Only share high/medium confidence information

### **Step 2: Source Prioritization**
```typescript
const sourcePriorities = {
  // Official sources (highest priority)
  'imdb.com': 11, 'marvel.com': 10, 'dc.com': 10, 'starwars.com': 10,
  
  // Industry news
  'variety.com': 8, 'hollywoodreporter.com': 8, 'deadline.com': 8,
  
  // Fan wikis
  'fandom.com': 9, 'memory-alpha.org': 9, 'wookieepedia.org': 9,
  
  // General news
  'cnn.com': 5, 'bbc.com': 5, 'reuters.com': 5,
};
```

### **Step 3: Correction Handling**
1. **Detection**: Identify correction patterns in user messages
2. **Extraction**: Extract corrected information
3. **Verification**: Research corrected information
4. **Memory Update**: Store correction for future reference
5. **Acknowledgment**: Thank user and provide corrected information

## 🧪 **Testing Framework**

### **Accuracy Prevention Tests**
```bash
# Test accuracy improvements
npm run test:accuracy

# Test specific components
npm run test:cast      # Cast accuracy
npm run test:dates     # Date accuracy
npm run test:rag       # RAG integration
```

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Cast Information**: Verify actor/character claims
2. **Release Dates**: Validate against current year
3. **Character Details**: Cross-reference official sources
4. **Trivia Facts**: Verify from industry sources
5. **Correction Detection**: Test various correction patterns
6. **Memory Persistence**: Ensure corrections are remembered
