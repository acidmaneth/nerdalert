# Dynamic Response Formatting - NerdAlert Agent v1.4.1

## üéØ **Overview**

NerdAlert now features **dynamic response formatting** that automatically adapts the agent's response style based on the user's intent. This provides a more personalized and efficient user experience by matching the response format to what the user is actually looking for.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **Intent Detection System**
The agent analyzes the user's message using pattern matching to detect their intent:

1. **List Intent**: User wants a list of items
2. **Deep Dive Intent**: User wants comprehensive, detailed information
3. **Quick Fact Intent**: User wants brief, essential information
4. **Conversation Intent**: User wants opinion-based discussion
5. **General Intent**: Default balanced response

### **Response Format Adaptation**
Based on detected intent, the agent automatically adjusts:

- **Response length** (concise vs. detailed)
- **Formatting style** (bulleted vs. conversational)
- **Detail level** (essential vs. comprehensive)
- **Tone** (factual vs. opinionated)

## üìã **Response Format Types**

### **1. Bulleted Format (List Intent)**
**Triggers**: "list of", "top 5", "best", "examples of", "bullet points"

**Response Style**:
- Precise bullet points with short descriptions
- Get straight to the point
- Minimal added context
- Focused and scannable

**Example**:
```
User: "List the top 5 Marvel movies"
Agent: "Here are the top 5 Marvel movies:
‚Ä¢ Avengers: Endgame (2019) - Highest-grossing film
‚Ä¢ Black Panther (2018) - Cultural phenomenon
‚Ä¢ Iron Man (2008) - Started the MCU
‚Ä¢ The Avengers (2012) - First team-up
‚Ä¢ Captain America: Civil War (2016) - Epic conflict"
```

### **2. Detailed Format (Deep Dive Intent)**
**Triggers**: "deep dive", "tell me everything", "explain in detail", "background", "origin story"

**Response Style**:
- Comprehensive explanations
- Rich context and background
- Thorough analysis
- Educational and informative

**Example**:
```
User: "Tell me everything about Spider-Man's origin story"
Agent: "Spider-Man's origin story is one of the most iconic in comic book history. Peter Parker was a brilliant but socially awkward high school student who was bitten by a radioactive spider during a science demonstration. This transformative event granted him spider-like abilities including enhanced strength, agility, wall-crawling, and a precognitive 'spider-sense' that warns him of danger..."
```

### **3. Concise Format (Quick Fact Intent)**
**Triggers**: "quick", "brief", "just", "simple", "what is"

**Response Style**:
- Brief and to the point
- Essential information only
- Minimal elaboration
- Fast answers

**Example**:
```
User: "Quick answer: who plays Batman?"
Agent: "Robert Pattinson plays Batman in The Batman (2022)."
```

### **4. Conversational Format (Conversation Intent)**
**Triggers**: "what do you think", "your opinion", "how do you feel", "compare", "versus"

**Response Style**:
- Natural, conversational language
- Personal opinions and thoughts
- Engaging dialogue
- More casual and opinionated

**Example**:
```
User: "What do you think about the latest Star Wars movie?"
Agent: "Honestly, I think it's a mixed bag! The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and the action sequences are some of the best in the franchise. But I have to say, the pacing felt a bit off in the middle act. What did you think about it?"
```

### **5. Natural Format (General Intent)**
**Default style for standard queries**

**Response Style**:
- Balanced detail level
- Natural conversation flow
- Appropriate context
- Matches user's energy

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Intent Detection Patterns**
```typescript
// List indicators
const listPatterns = [
  /list of/i, /list the/i, /what are the/i, /name the/i, /give me a list/i,
  /top \d+/i, /best \d+/i, /worst \d+/i, /favorite \d+/i,
  /examples of/i, /types of/i, /kinds of/i, /sorts of/i,
  /bullet points/i, /bullet list/i, /numbered list/i,
  /all the/i, /every/i, /each/i, /multiple/i
];

// Deep dive indicators
const deepDivePatterns = [
  /deep dive/i, /in depth/i, /detailed/i, /comprehensive/i,
  /explain in detail/i, /tell me everything/i, /full story/i,
  /background/i, /history/i, /origin story/i, /behind the scenes/i,
  /how did/i, /why did/i, /what happened/i, /what's the story/i,
  /elaborate/i, /expand on/i, /more about/i, /tell me more/i
];

// Quick fact indicators
const quickFactPatterns = [
  /quick/i, /fast/i, /brief/i, /short/i, /simple/i,
  /just/i, /only/i, /basic/i, /main/i, /key/i,
  /what is/i, /who is/i, /when is/i, /where is/i,
  /one thing/i, /single/i, /fact/i, /info/i
];

// Conversation indicators
const conversationPatterns = [
  /what do you think/i, /your opinion/i, /your thoughts/i,
  /how do you feel/i, /do you like/i, /do you prefer/i,
  /compare/i, /versus/i, /vs/i, /better/i, /worse/i,
  /discuss/i, /talk about/i, /chat about/i, /conversation/i,
  /debate/i, /argue/i, /disagree/i, /agree/i
];
```

### **System Prompt Integration**
The detected intent is integrated into the system prompt with specific formatting instructions:

```typescript
const systemPromptWithDate = (sessionId?: string, userMessage?: string) => {
  const intent = userMessage ? detectUserIntent(userMessage) : {
    intent: 'general',
    format: 'natural',
    instructions: `RESPONSE FORMAT: Use natural, balanced responses that match the user's energy and provide appropriate detail level.`
  };
  
  return `${systemPrompt}
  // ... other instructions ...
  ${intent.instructions}
  `;
};
```
