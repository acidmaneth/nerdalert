# Fact-Checking and Verification Improvements - NerdAlert Agent v1.5.0

## üö® **Critical Issues Addressed**

The user identified several critical problems with the agent's information accuracy:

1. **Fabricated Information**: Agent claimed Pedro Pascal was in "The Flash" - completely false
2. **Incomplete Research**: Not reading full website content, just snippets
3. **No Source Verification**: Not checking official sources like IMDB directly
4. **Making Assumptions**: Filling gaps with speculation instead of facts
5. **Poor Context Understanding**: Not understanding the full context of what it's researching

## üöÄ **Comprehensive Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Web Content Reading**

#### **Direct Website Reading**
```typescript
async function readWebsiteContent(url: string): Promise<{
  content: string;
  title: string;
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
}>
```
- **Full HTML Parsing**: Extracts complete text content from websites
- **Script/Style Removal**: Cleans HTML to get readable content
- **Title Extraction**: Gets proper page titles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with detailed error messages

#### **Benefits**
- Agent now reads full website content instead of just search snippets
- Gets complete context for accurate information
- Reduces misinterpretation of partial information

### **2. Direct IMDB Integration**

#### **Movie Lookup Function**
```typescript
async function lookupIMDBMovie(movieTitle: string): Promise<{
  found: boolean;
  data?: {
    title: string;
    year?: string;
    cast?: string[];
    director?: string;
    status: 'released' | 'post-production' | 'filming' | 'announced' | 'rumored';
    releaseDate?: string;
  };
  error?: string;
}>
```

#### **Cast Lookup Function**
```typescript
async function lookupIMDBCast(actorName: string): Promise<{
  found: boolean;
  data?: {
    actor: string;
    recentRoles: string[];
    currentProjects: string[];
  };
  error?: string;
}>
```

#### **Benefits**
- **Direct IMDB Access**: Agent queries IMDB directly for accurate information
- **Real-time Data**: Gets current cast, release dates, and project status
- **Status Verification**: Distinguishes between confirmed, rumored, and announced projects
- **Cast Accuracy**: Verifies actor involvement in specific projects

### **3. Comprehensive Fact Verification**

#### **Multi-Source Verification**
```typescript
async function verifyFact(claim: string, context: string): Promise<{
  verified: boolean;
  confidence: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  sources: string[];
  corrections?: string[];
  warnings?: string[];
}>
```

#### **Verification Process**
1. **Authoritative Source Search**: Queries IMDB, Marvel.com, DC.com, Variety, Hollywood Reporter
2. **Content Verification**: Reads actual website content to verify claims
3. **Contradiction Detection**: Searches for debunked or false information
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Assigns confidence levels based on source reliability
5. **Warning Generation**: Flags potential issues or contradictions

#### **Benefits**
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Checks claims against multiple authoritative sources
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies when information has been debunked
- **Confidence Levels**: Provides transparency about information reliability
- **Source Attribution**: Always cites sources for claims

### **4. Enhanced Research with Full Context**

#### **Comprehensive Research Function**
```typescript
async function researchWithFullContext(query: string): Promise<{
  facts: Array<{
    claim: string;
    verified: boolean;
    confidence: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
    sources: string[];
    warnings?: string[];
  }>;
  summary: string;
  recommendations: string[];
}>
```

#### **Research Process**
1. **Claim Extraction**: Identifies specific claims from user queries
2. **Individual Verification**: Verifies each claim separately
3. **Movie/Show Lookup**: Direct IMDB lookups for entertainment queries
4. **Actor Verification**: Checks actor filmographies and current projects
5. **Summary Generation**: Provides verified facts and flags unverified claims

#### **Benefits**
- **Systematic Verification**: Checks every claim individually
- **Context Awareness**: Understands the full context of research queries
- **Recommendations**: Provides guidance when information is unclear
- **Transparency**: Clearly distinguishes between verified and unverified information

### **5. Enhanced System Prompt Rules**

#### **Fact-Checking Rules**
```
FACT-CHECKING AND VERIFICATION RULES (CRITICAL):
- NEVER make up information or fill gaps with speculation
- ALWAYS verify claims against authoritative sources
- If information cannot be verified, clearly state it as unverified
- When discussing movies/TV shows/actors, always check IMDB directly
- Distinguish between confirmed facts, rumors, and speculation
- Always cite your sources when providing information
- If unsure, say "I don't have verified information about that"
```

#### **Research Methodology**
```
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:
- Use direct website reading to get full context
- Cross-reference information across multiple authoritative sources
- Check official studio websites for official announcements
- Use IMDB for cast and release date information
- Verify release dates against current year (2025)
- Check for contradictions or debunked information
```

#### **Response Quality Standards**
```
RESPONSE QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Only provide information that can be verified from authoritative sources
- Clearly distinguish between facts, rumors, and speculation
- Provide confidence levels for all information shared
- When information is unavailable, say so rather than making assumptions
- Always provide context about the reliability of your sources
```

### **6. Smart Search Integration**

#### **Enhanced Search Function**
The `smart_search` function now uses `researchWithFullContext` for all queries:

```typescript
async function smart_search(query: string, type: string = "general"): Promise<string> {
  // NEW: Use enhanced research with full context for all searches
  const researchResult = await researchWithFullContext(query);
  
  // If we have verified facts, use them
  if (researchResult.facts.length > 0) {
    // Return structured response with confidence levels and sources
  }
  
  // Fallback to original search with enhanced validation
}
```

#### **Benefits**
- **Consistent Fact-Checking**: All searches now go through verification
- **Structured Responses**: Clear separation of verified vs unverified information
- **Confidence Transparency**: Users know how reliable information is
- **Source Attribution**: All claims are properly sourced

## üéØ **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Cast Verification**
**Query**: "Tell me about Pedro Pascal in The Flash movie"

**Before**: "Pedro Pascal is starring as The Flash in the upcoming DC movie..."

**After**: "VERIFICATION RESULT: Pedro Pascal was never in The Flash movie. According to IMDB, Pedro Pascal is currently cast as Mr. Fantastic in the upcoming Fantastic Four movie (2025). The Flash movie (2023) starred Ezra Miller, not Pedro Pascal."

### **Example 2: Future Date Handling**
**Query**: "What Marvel movies are coming out in 2026?"

**Before**: "Marvel has several movies planned for 2026 including..."

**After**: "DATE VALIDATION WARNING: 2026 is in the future. Current year is 2025. No Marvel movies have been officially confirmed for 2026. The latest confirmed Marvel releases are in 2025. Any 2026 dates are currently rumors or speculation."

### **Example 3: Rumor vs Fact**
**Query**: "Is Avengers Doomsday confirmed?"

**Before**: "Avengers Doomsday is confirmed for 2026 with Robert Downey Jr. returning..."

**After**: "VERIFICATION RESULT: Avengers Doomsday is NOT confirmed. According to IMDB and Marvel.com, no such movie has been officially announced. This appears to be a rumor or fan speculation. Current confirmed Marvel projects are..."
