# Enhanced Date Accuracy Improvements - NerdAlert Agent v1.4.1

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The agent was providing outdated information and incorrectly stating that movies weren't out yet when they had already been released. Key issues included:

1. **Future Date Confusion**: Agent would mention 2026/2027 dates as if they were confirmed releases
2. **Outdated Information**: Agent would reference old release dates without current year context
3. **Lack of Cross-Referencing**: No validation between movie titles, cast information, and release dates
4. **Missing Current Year Awareness**: Agent didn't consistently validate dates against the current year (2025)

## 🚀 **Comprehensive Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Date Validation System**

#### **Current Year Context Injection**
```typescript
const currentDateTime = getCurrentDateTime();
// Always provides: { year: 2025, month: 12, day: 29, date: "Sunday, December 29, 2025" }
```

#### **Future Date Detection**
```typescript
const validateDateAccuracy = (mentionedDate: string, context: string): string => {
  const currentYear = currentDateTime.year; // 2025
  
  // Extract year from mentioned date
  const yearMatch = mentionedDate.match(/\b(19|20)\d{2}\b/);
  if (yearMatch) {
    const year = parseInt(yearMatch[0]);
    
    // Check if year is in the future
    if (year > currentYear) {
      return `DATE VALIDATION WARNING: The year ${year} mentioned in "${context}" is in the future. Current year is ${currentYear}. This may be a prediction, rumor, or error.`;
    }
  }
  
  return "";
};
```

### **2. Cross-Referencing System**

#### **Title-Cast-Date Validation**
```typescript
const validateAndCrossReferenceDates = async (content: string, searchResults: any[]): Promise<{
  validatedContent: string;
  warnings: string[];
  confidence: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
}> => {
  // Extract movie titles and cast information
  const movieTitles = extractMovieTitles(content);
  const castInfo = extractCastInfo(content);
  
  // Cross-reference each component
  for (const title of movieTitles) {
    const titleValidation = await crossReferenceMovieTitle(title, searchResults);
    if (titleValidation.warning) {
      warnings.push(titleValidation.warning);
    }
  }
  
  for (const cast of castInfo) {
    const castValidation = await crossReferenceCastInfo(cast, searchResults);
    if (castValidation.warning) {
      warnings.push(castValidation.warning);
    }
  }
  
  return { validatedContent, warnings, confidence };
};
```

#### **Movie Title Extraction**
```typescript
const extractMovieTitles = (content: string): string[] => {
  const titles: string[] = [];
  
  // Look for quoted titles: "Fantastic Four"
  const quotedMatches = content.match(/"([^"]+)"/g) || [];
  
  // Look for titles with years: "Fantastic Four (2025)"
  const yearMatches = content.match(/([A-Z][A-Za-z\s&:]+)\s*\((\d{4})\)/g) || [];
  
  return [...new Set(titles)];
};
```

#### **Cast Information Extraction**
```typescript
const extractCastInfo = (content: string): Array<{actor: string, character: string}> => {
  // Look for "Actor (Character)" patterns
  const castMatches = content.match(/([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+)\s*\(([^)]+)\)/g) || [];
  
  return castMatches.map(match => {
    const castMatch = match.match(/([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+)\s*\(([^)]+)\)/);
    return {
      actor: castMatch[1].trim(),
      character: castMatch[2].trim()
    };
  });
};
```

### **3. Enhanced Smart Search Integration**

#### **Validation in Search Results**
```typescript
async function smart_search(query: string, type: string = "general"): Promise<string> {
  // ... existing search logic ...
  
  // NEW: Enhanced validation and cross-referencing
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(5, prioritizedResults.length); i++) {
    const result = prioritizedResults[i];
    
    // Validate this result
    const validation = await validateAndCrossReferenceDates(snippet, prioritizedResults);
    const releaseValidation = await verifyReleaseDates(snippet);
    
    // Combine warnings and adjust confidence
    const allWarnings = [...validation.warnings, ...releaseValidation.warnings];
    if (allWarnings.length > 0) {
      validationWarnings.push(`Result ${i + 1}: ${allWarnings.join('; ')}`);
      if (validation.confidence === 'LOW' || releaseValidation.confidence === 'LOW') {
        overallConfidence = 'LOW';
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Add validation to response
  let response = `SEARCH RESULTS (${prioritizedResults.length} found):\n\n${formattedResults}`;
  response += `\n📅 CURRENT CONTEXT: Today is ${currentDateTime.date}, ${currentDateTime.year}\n`;
  
  if (validationWarnings.length > 0) {
    response += `\n⚠️ VALIDATION WARNINGS:\n${validationWarnings.map(w => `• ${w}`).join('\n')}\n`;
  }
  
  response += `\n🎯 OVERALL CONFIDENCE: ${overallConfidence}`;
  
  return response;
}
```

### **4. Enhanced System Prompt Rules**

#### **Comprehensive Date Accuracy Rules**
```text
ENHANCED DATE ACCURACY RULES (CRITICAL - PREVENTS FALSE CLAIMS):
- CURRENT YEAR AWARENESS: You are in 2025. Any date beyond this year is likely incorrect or a prediction
- FUTURE DATE VALIDATION: If you find dates in 2026 or later, they are predictions/rumors, not confirmed releases
- RELEASE DATE VERIFICATION: Always search for "latest release date" or "current status" for movies/TV shows
- CROSS-REFERENCE DATES: When you find a release date, cross-reference it with the movie title and cast information
- DATE-TITLE-CAST VALIDATION: If a date doesn't match the title or cast information, flag it as potentially incorrect
- OFFICIAL SOURCE PRIORITY: Trust official studio announcements over fan sites or rumors
- CONFIDENCE REPORTING: Always report confidence levels for date information (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- OUTDATED INFORMATION FLAGGING: If information seems outdated for current year, search for recent updates
- MULTIPLE SOURCE VERIFICATION: Verify dates across multiple authoritative sources
- RUMOR VS CONFIRMED: Clearly distinguish between rumored dates and confirmed release dates
```

## 📊 **Expected Improvements**

### **Before (Issues)**
- Agent would say "Fantastic Four coming in 2026" without validation
- No cross-referencing between titles, cast, and dates
- Outdated information presented as current
- No confidence levels for date information
- Future dates treated as confirmed releases

### **After (Improvements)**
- **Future Date Detection**: Automatically flags dates beyond 2025
- **Cross-Referencing**: Validates titles against cast information
- **Current Year Context**: Always aware of 2025 and validates accordingly
- **Confidence Levels**: Transparent reporting of accuracy levels
- **Validation Warnings**: Clear flags for potentially incorrect information
- **Multiple Source Verification**: Cross-references across authoritative sources

## 🧪 **Testing Framework**

### **New Test Script**
```bash
# Test enhanced date accuracy
npm run test:enhanced-dates
```

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Future Date Detection**: "What Marvel movies are coming out in 2026?"
2. **Title-Cast Cross-Reference**: "Tell me about the Fantastic Four movie with Pedro Pascal"
3. **Current Status Verification**: "What's the latest on Captain America: Brave New World?"
4. **Release Date Validation**: "When is the next Star Wars movie coming out?"
5. **Current Year Validation**: "What DC movies are scheduled for 2025?"

### **Validation Checks**
- ✅ Current year context (2025) in responses
- ✅ Validation warnings for future dates
- ✅ Confidence levels reported
- ✅ Cross-referencing between titles and cast
- ✅ Multiple source verification

## 🎯 **Specific Problem Resolution**

### **Issue: "Fantastic Four coming in 2026"**
**Before**: Agent would state this as fact
**After**: Agent will flag 2026 as future date and search for current status

### **Issue: Outdated Cast Information**
**Before**: Agent would mention old cast without verification
**After**: Agent cross-references cast with movie titles and validates

### **Issue: Missing Current Year Context**
**Before**: Agent would discuss "upcoming" movies without year context
**After**: Agent always provides current year context and validates dates

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified**
1. `src/prompt/index.ts` - Enhanced validation functions
2. `src/system-prompt.txt` - Comprehensive date accuracy rules
3. `test-enhanced-date-accuracy.js` - New test script
