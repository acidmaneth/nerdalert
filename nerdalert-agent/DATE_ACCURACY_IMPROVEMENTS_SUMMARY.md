# Date Accuracy Improvements Summary - NerdAlert Agent

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Addressed**

The user reported that the agent was struggling with dates, saying movies weren't out yet when they had already been released. The agent was providing outdated information and not properly validating dates against the current year (2025).

## ðŸš€ **Comprehensive Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Date Validation System**

#### **Current Year Context**
- Agent now always aware of current year (2025)
- All dates validated against current year context
- Future dates automatically flagged as predictions/rumors

#### **Future Date Detection**
```typescript
// Automatically detects and flags future dates
if (year > currentYear) {
  return `DATE VALIDATION WARNING: The year ${year} mentioned in "${context}" is in the future. Current year is ${currentYear}. This may be a prediction, rumor, or error.`;
}
```

### **2. Cross-Referencing System**

#### **Title-Cast-Date Validation**
- Extracts movie titles from content (quoted titles, titles with years)
- Extracts cast information (Actor (Character) patterns)
- Cross-references titles with cast information
- Validates all components against authoritative sources

#### **Multiple Source Verification**
- Validates information across multiple sources
- Prioritizes official sources (marvel.com, dc.com, imdb.com)
- Provides confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### **3. Enhanced Smart Search Integration**

#### **Validation in Search Results**
- Every search result is validated for date accuracy
- Cross-references titles, cast, and dates
- Provides validation warnings for potentially incorrect information
- Reports overall confidence level for search results

#### **Current Context Injection**
- Always includes current year context in responses
- Provides recommendations based on confidence level
- Flags outdated or potentially incorrect information

### **4. Comprehensive System Prompt Rules**

#### **Enhanced Date Accuracy Rules**
- Current year awareness (2025)
- Future date validation (2026+ flagged as predictions)
- Release date verification with latest information
- Cross-referencing between dates, titles, and cast
- Official source prioritization
- Confidence level reporting

npm run test:accuracy

# Test date accuracy
npm run test:dates
```

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Future Date Detection**: "What Marvel movies are coming out in 2026?"
2. **Title-Cast Cross-Reference**: "Tell me about the Fantastic Four movie with Pedro Pascal"
3. **Current Status Verification**: "What's the latest on Captain America: Brave New World?"
